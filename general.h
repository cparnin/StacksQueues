This utility function accepts as an argument a pointer of any type whatsoever.
It tests the pointer "p" to see whether it is NULL, and if it is, the function
terminates the program with an error message saying "dynamic allocation
failed."  If "p" is not NULL, the function does nothing.  This function is NOT 
a member of the "stack_of" class.  Documented and coded by W. Knight.  */

void testAllocation(void *p);

// Reads a number between 0 and the limit. If the user enters
// something outside the limit, they are asked to enter the number
// again.
